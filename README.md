# neophilus.net

I don't use my `www` domain, since there's a bunch of projects I like to keep separate.
So instead I have this 'landing' page (for lack of a better word).

## Actual locations

- [Axiomatic Semantics](https://axiomatic.neophilus.net) &mdash; Personal blog, mainly code and math related.
- [Odyssey](https://odyssey.neophilus.net) &mdash; Travel/photoblog.
- [Šumeru liḫšu](https://www.neophilus.net/whispers/) &mdash; Gallery for an art piece that I worked on in another life.
- [CQPLαbs](https://cqplabs.neophilus.net/) &mdash; A now defunct skunkworks page from my PhD days.
